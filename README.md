# Hung-yi-Lee-Course
There are my projects for the Machine Learning course at the National Taiwan University (NTU)

Course Web : https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php

Instructor: Hung-yi Lee

<br> 

Note :  
  * All of the projects run on Jupter Notebook(.ipynb ), remember to adjust the environment setting ( Colab drive mount, file directory... ) before you use it
  * To get the source data, you can reference the content in each project file or the slide of each project introduction on course web 
   
  * I mainly focus on understanding the concept and the implementation of the related models, you can further enhance the result by adjusting model architecture/parameters yourself : )
